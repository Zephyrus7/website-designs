<p>We are supposed to drink lots of H<sub>2</sub>O since our body needs to maintain itself.
<p>My preferred brand of mobile device is Samsung<sup>&reg;</sup> however, recent device security/modification policies being pushed by the brand has been implementing structures on their devices that results in increased difficulty modifying extensive system properties by end-users. One of these structures, which is KNOX security, significantly improves device security for stock users. However for superusers, altering system image(s) such as flashing Custom ROMs, goes through the structure and as soon as KNOX detects system modification, triggers eFuse resulting in warranty invalidation.</p>

<p>One of my favorite quote is: </p>
<blockquote>
